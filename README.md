This study examines the persistence of post-earnings announcement drift (PEAD) in U.S.
equity markets using data from 50 large-cap firms between 2000 and 2023. Standardized
earnings surprises (SUE) are constructed from both accounting data and IBES forecasts.
Event study methods and cross-sectional regressions reveal statistically significant drift for
accounting-based SUEs, especially under Fama-French and fixed-effects models. Firms
in the top SUE decile earn up higher CARs than bottom-decile peers.
